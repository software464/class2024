every function for an array.

our check will see if they are all uppercase using  built in toUppercase 
function(checking every individual letter is too painstaking)
.

we need to:
callback to check if word is uppercase.
we need to do for every single one. so best option is to check for false. and return that.
if they are all true then well return true.



///.
ourEvery(arraay, callback){
    for(array.length){
        if(callbacknumbers[i]){

        }
    }

}

ran into problems bec the"!" was not returning the correct evaluation well continue tom


3 functions:
every.
some.
onlyif: 3 params array clb action.
this should use built in filter and for each.
(unclear if should make diff onlyif without  any built in functions)
