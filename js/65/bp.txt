we need to write 2 functions that accepts one param.
we need to do math on this param in the body of the function and return the result.
well focus on celsius first once we learn how to write the math for that well do farenhait.
main challenge is to figure out how to write tha math for number to be returned.
in pseodo code it will look something lile this:
return a/5*9+32. maybe ((a/5)*9)+32. yes well try this. well do in console first.
YES IT WORKED IN CONSOLE!!!
so lets now just spell out the function.
function convert(x){
    return ((x/5)*9)+32
    //celsius ((x-32)*5)/9
}
