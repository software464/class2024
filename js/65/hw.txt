For homework:
We didn't really get past the introductory stage far enough to write any substantial JavaScript, but for homework, practice writing some functions and calling them. Make sure to use a linter with decent rules set up (extend eslint recommended to start with), 'use strict', and let and const instead of var.
Write two functions, one to convert Farenheit to Celsius, and one to convert Celsius to Farenheit. Call each with several values and print out the result. Formulas to convert are:
    째C to 째F - Divide by 5, then multiply by 9, then add 32
    째F to 째C - Deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
Use prompt to get a value from the user to convert and then use alert to show them the result.
